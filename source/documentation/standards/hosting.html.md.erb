# <%= current_page.data.title %>

At MOJ you must use the [Cloud
Platform](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) to
host your service unless you're advised otherwise by a member of [the
hosting team](https://peoplefinder.service.gov.uk/teams/hosting). Your
team can get started on the Cloud Platform without letting anyone know;
just follow [the Cloud Platform documentation](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) and
get in touch with the Cloud Platform team if you need help.

The Cloud Platform is a modern hosting platform for digital services:

- It makes it quick and easy to 'just deploy an app'
- Teams get the features they need to operate their service, such as
  easy scalability, zero downtime deploys, security scanning,
  monitoring, logging, and more, all setup for you by default
- When you need the full power of AWS or Kubernetes, it's all available
- Configuration is all self-service, using Infrastructure as Code with
  managed CI/CD and GitOps processes
- The Cloud Platform team manage the hosting and provide support for
  the platform

If you think that your service might require other hosting, [get in
touch with the hosting
team](mailto:hosting-leads@digital.justice.gov.uk) and we'll help
identify which of our other hosting options is best for your service,
or set up extra accounts if we've already identified the right
setup for you:

- AWS Modernisation Platform (currently in development; [get in touch
  with the team](mailto:modernisation-platform@digital.justice.gov.uk)
  if you'd like to learn more)
- LAA AWS and 6Degrees infrastructure
- HMPPS Azure infrastructure
- Self-managed AWS infrastructure
- Retirement infrastructure

## We use public cloud hosting by default

We follow the [Government Cloud First
policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy) and
use public cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a
Service (IaaS) infrastructure to host our services.

Our choice of cloud platforms:

- are highly scalable and available to meet the needs of service users
- have automated tools for MOJ administrators to manage their
  environments

We currently use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
by default for scalable computing, storage and deployment services, but
we may recommend some services are hosted in [Microsoft
Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), based on the needs of the service
and its relationship to other services already in Azure.

If your service is currently hosted outside of AWS or Azure, get in
touch with [the Application Modernisation team](#TODO) to plan for its
future hosting.

## We pay for hosting centrally by default

By default, we pay for all use of AWS and Azure services (and some
others) across MOJ (excluding HMCTS) centrally. As part of this, the
hosting team will routinely review your use of hosting to ensure you're
using infrastructure appropriately, keeping it secure, keeping it up to
date, and making the best use of the money you're spending.

If your service or services cost more than Â£30,000 per year to host, we
may need to cross-charge you for your use. In this case, we will still
work with you to ensure you're using your infrastructure appropriately
and safely. This typically only applies to very large services or
teams, and we only currently cross-charge two groups.
